# Bulk-Image-downloader

WIP
Chrome extension that should get all images on a webpage and mass download them from the popup.

Does not work as inteded, it has very limited functionality.
Only works on Google Images search where it only gets a few results on the initial search.
Scrolling down makes more apear. The results vary depending on the search topic.

Problem should be in the image identiffyng criteria.
