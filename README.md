# Bulk-Image-downloader

WIP
Chrome extension that should get all images on a webpage and mass download them from the popup.

Does not work as inteded, it has very limited functionality.
Only works on Google Images search.
It only gets a few results on the initial search.
Scrolling down makes more apear.
